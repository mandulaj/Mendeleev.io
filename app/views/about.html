  <h1>
    Why we created Mendeleev.io
  </h1>
  <span>
  We were inspired to create something different in Chemistry class while repeatedly solving boring calculations.
  It should make it possible for everyone to solve chemical problems simply using a friendly interface.

  <a href="https://github.com/zpiman">@zpiman</a> suggested the name mendeleev.io, we found that it was still available,
  we immediately registered it.
