Mendeleev.io
============
http://mendeleev.io

The online chemistry engine.

Setup
============

Get node.js and npm (http://www.nodejs.org)

```
cd Mendeleev.io
npm install

sudo npm install -g bower
cd app
bower install
```

Why
============

We were inspired to create something different in Chemistry class while repeatedly solving boring calculations.
It should make it possible for everyone to solve chemical problems simply using a friendly interface.

@zpiman suggested the name mendeleev.io, and right after we found that it was actually not yet taken,
we immediately registered it.

Status
============

Mendeleev.io is a very new project, but we are working to make it usable as fast as possible.
